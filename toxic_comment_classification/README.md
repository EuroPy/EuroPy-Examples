# EuroPy Example: Toxic Comment Classification

## Overview
* [Kaggle Challenge & Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)
* Heavily inspired from this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/nkaenzig/bert-tensorflow-2-huggingface-transformers)

The model is trained in `toxic_comment_classification.ipynb` using a pretrained BERT model from HuggingFace. The latest model and details are uploaded to S3. The testing and report generations is found in `model_test.ipynb`. `model_test.ipynb` will download the latest version of the model trained in `toxic_comment_classification.ipynb`.

## To run:
* Both notebooks should run end to end with provided inline instructions.

## Report
Latest Generated Report is found [here](report/report.md).
